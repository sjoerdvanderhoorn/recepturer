# Recepturer

Manage all your recipes in one app, store the data anywhere you like. The service remains free and without ads forever, and your data stays yours.

Include the quantities needed for each ingredient as you author your recipe, and Recepturer automatically aggregates everything you need. Adding a recipe to your meal plan transfers over the required ingredients to a shopping list. Easily change quantities or check off items you already have in stock. Add extra items such as your weekly batch of chocolate chip cookies and arrange the product over different categories such as vegetables, dairy, condiments, grains, and fruits and order them according to the layout of your favorite local supermarket. Everything is self guided. There is no need to worry about maintaining database records or data entry you don't need.
